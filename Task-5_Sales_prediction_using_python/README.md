# 📊 Task 5 - Sales Prediction Using Python

### 🔍 Objective:
Sales prediction means estimating how much of a product people will buy based on advertising spending. This helps businesses make data-driven decisions by understanding which platform (TV, Radio, Newspaper) impacts sales the most.

---

### 🧠 What We Did:
- Loaded and explored the **Advertising dataset**.
- Visualized the relationships between ad channels and sales.
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model.
- Evaluated performance using:
  - 📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - 📈 R² Score
- Visualized **Actual vs Predicted** sales.

---

### 📁 Dataset:
- **File**: `Advertising.csv`
- **Columns**:
  - `TV`: Money spent on TV ads.
  - `Radio`: Money spent on Radio ads.
  - `Newspaper`: Money spent on Newspaper ads.
  - `Sales`: Units sold (target variable).

### 📌 Technologies Used:
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📑
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🖌️
- Scikit-learn 🤖

---

### 📷 Sample Outputs:

#### 📉 Correlation Heatmap:
Shows how strongly each channel is related to sales.

#### 📈 Actual vs Predicted Plot:
Gives a visual comparison between model predictions and actual results.
